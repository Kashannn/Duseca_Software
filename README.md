Create an application that enables users to upload various types of activities, including text-only, text with images, text with PDF files, text with both images and PDFs, as well as standalone images or PDFs.

Additionally, provide users with a separate screen to view their uploaded activities. It is imperative to ensure that the visual representation of these activities is distinct for each category, reflecting the type of content they contain.

Your performance will be assessed based on your adherence to coding conventions and the architectural pattern you employ.

(Use Firebase Firestore for data storage and Firebase Storage for storing images and pdfs.)
